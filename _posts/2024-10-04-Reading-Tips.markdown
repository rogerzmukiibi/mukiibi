# Review Paper Writing Tips
1. Read at least five high-quality chapters on a similar topic to make yours better.
2. Gather and read about 50-100 original articles on a topic within your scientific field.
3. Write down a list of about 5-8 subtopics that will constitute a draft of your article sections.
4. Write in each section 1-3 paragraphs including one illustration showing the section point: a figure, a table, a scheme or a photo.
5. Write the introduction section starting by 1-2 paragraphs of societal and general issues, almost readable by the public, and then write 1-2 paragraphs of scientific issues related to your topic. Insert in the introduction a figure containing 1-2 nice color photos related to the topic and readable by the public, this will highly increase the visibility of your review article.
6. Write the title using both specific and general keywords. Please note that your title must be readable by scientists out of your field, because science is interdisciplinary.

# General Tips
- Keep abbreviation number to a very strict minimum. Explain all abbreviations. Note that most readers are not in your field, and most readers do not read from start to end. This phenomenon called bits reading is amplified by digital reading. In other words an out of the field reader starting reading at e.g. page 5 will not understand an uncommon abbreviation, and will thus stop reading your article.
- Abbreviations in figures and tables must be explained at the end of the caption.
- Avoid long, multiverb sentence. Write simple, monoverb sentences in the order subject-verb-object.
- Avoid everywhere long expressions in (): this causes heavy reading. Replace by “, ; e.g. such as” … Or split sentences. One message only per sentence.
- No sentence alone. Write in paragraphs everywhere. A paragraph is not a sum of sentences; a paragraph is a story or a demonstration.
- Insert the digital object identifier (DOI), when available, at the end of references, this will increase visibility. Check that references in the text are in the list, and vice versa, this will save weeks of delay at the publishing stage.
- Figures and tables should be understandable and citable without reading the article text. Therefore figure captions should include 2-3 sentences to describe the trend, result or fact to be observed, and its scientific significance. This will highly increase the impact. Indeed many readers start by reading figures.
- Please note that figures, especially photos, have 100 times more communicative power than text. Readers like illustrations, especially those that show things that they see every day: plants, animals, tools and objects.
